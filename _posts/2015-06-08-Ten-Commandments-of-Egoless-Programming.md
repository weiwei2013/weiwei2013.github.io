<b>anchorPint  和中心点possition重合的一个点，称之为“锚点”，锚点是的描述是相对于X，Y位置比例威严的默认是在图像中心点(0.5 , 0.5)的位置
backgroundColor 图层背景颜色
borederColor   边框颜色
borderWidth     边框宽
bounds             图层大小
contents            图层显示内容的大小和位置
cornerRadius     圆角半径
doubleSided       图层背面是否显示，默认为YES
frame                   图层大小和位置，不支持隐士动画，所以CALayer中很少使用frame，通常使用bounds和position代替
hidden               是否隐藏
mask              图层蒙版
maskToBounds   子图层是否剪切图层边界，默认为NO
opacity         透明度，类似于UIView的alpha
position   图层中心店位置，类似于UIView的center
shadowColor       阴影颜色
shadowOffset      阴影偏移量
shadowOpacity   阴影透明度
shadowPath        阴影模糊半径
sublayers             子图层
sublayerTransform  子图层形变

<b>1. Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.</b> The point is to find them early, before they make it into production. Fortunately, except for the few of us developing rocket guidance software at JPL, mistakes are rarely fatal in our industry, so we can, and should, learn, laugh, and move on.
<br><br><b>2. You are not your code.</b> Remember that the entire point of a review is to find problems, and problems will be found. Don't take it personally when one is uncovered.
<br><br><b>3. No matter how much "karate" you know, someone else will always know more.</b> Such an individual can teach you some new moves if you ask. Seek and accept input from others, especially when you think it's not needed.
<br><br><b>4. Don't rewrite code without consultation.</b> There's a fine line between "fixing code" and "rewriting code." Know the difference, and pursue stylistic changes within the framework of a code review, not as a lone enforcer.
<br><br><b>5. Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience.</b> Nontechnical people who deal with developers on a regular basis almost universally hold the opinion that we are prima donnas at best and crybabies at worst. Don't reinforce this stereotype with anger and impatience.
<br><br><b>6. The only constant in the world is change.</b> Be open to it and accept it with a smile. Look at each change to your requirements, platform, or tool as a new challenge, not as some serious inconvenience to be fought.
<br><br><b>7. The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.</b> Knowledge engenders authority, and authority engenders respect – so if you want respect in an egoless environment, cultivate knowledge.
<br><br><b>8. Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat.</b> Understand that sometimes your ideas will be overruled. Even if you do turn out to be right, don't take revenge or say, "I told you so" more than a few times at most, and don't make your dearly departed idea a martyr or rallying cry.
<br><br><b>9. Don't be "the guy in the room."</b> Don't be the guy coding in the dark office emerging only to buy cola. The guy in the room is out of touch, out of sight, and out of control and has no place in an open, collaborative environment.
<br><br><b>10. Critique code instead of people – be kind to the coder, not to the code.</b> As much as possible, make all of your comments positive and oriented to improving the code. Relate comments to local standards, program specs, increased performance, etc.

(The Psychology of Computer Programming was written way back in 1971)
